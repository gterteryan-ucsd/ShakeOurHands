                    The chosen PID controls were speed at around 74, P at around 13, and I and D at 0.

                    For the circuit, speed was slightly decreased while P was slightly increased, allowing for better turning without much overshoot.
                    We got 12.09 loops, placing us at 12th place.

                    For the drag race, speed was slightly increased while P was slightly increased as well, allowing better speed while still keeping up with the track's turns.
                    We got a time of around 30 seconds, and we were eliminated in our 2nd round, making us among the last place teams.

                    For the filter pass, both speed and P were slightly decreased because of one turn that was causing some issue with overshoot.
                    We barely managed to pass after our 2nd set of attempts at around 34 seconds, putting us among the last place teams.

                    The majority of the last week was spent simply trying to fix the robot. Whether it was PID controls being inconsistemt, 
                    trying to make a good enough light shield, or soldering back on wires that had broken off, a lot of things happened that 
                    occasionally made us think that we wouldn't finish the robot in time. And yet, after the final touch of adding LEDs under 
                    the light shield, we managed to somehow make it work and passed every single course, even if it was quite slow. If we had 
                    the to create a good light shield in CAD and print it out, that would've probably made the robot perform a lot better. 
                    However, none of us had good enough ideas for a light shield that wouldn't take hours to print, so it was a missed 
                    opportunity.
